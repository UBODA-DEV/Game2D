# Game2D
2D Adventure Game
A simple 2D game engine built in Java as a learning project. This game features basic player movement controls using the WASD keys and implements a game loop with consistent frame rate.
Project Overview
This repository contains my journey learning Java programming through game development. I'm using this project to understand core Java concepts such as:

Object-oriented programming
Event handling
Graphics rendering
Thread management
Game loop implementation

The game currently includes a movable character (represented as a white square) that can navigate around a black screen using WASD controls.
Learning Goals
This is an exercise to help me learn:

Java programming fundamentals
Game development concepts
Version control with Git and GitHub
Software architecture principles

Development Approach
I'm implementing this project using pair programming with AI assistance to:

Add comprehensive code comments
Explain complex Java concepts
Document the codebase for better understanding
Learn best practices for code organization and structure

This collaborative approach helps me understand the code more deeply while maintaining clean, well-documented implementations.

Current Features
Game window with fixed dimensions
Basic player movement with WASD keys
Consistent frame rate (60 FPS)
Double buffering for smooth rendering

Feel free to explore the code as I continue to expand this project with new features while advancing my Java skills!
