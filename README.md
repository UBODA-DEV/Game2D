Game2D<br><br>
A simple 2D game engine built in Java as a learning project.<br> This game features basic player movement controls using the WASD keys and implements a game loop with consistent frame rate.

Project Overview<br><br>
This repository contains my journey learning Java programming through game development.<br> I'm using this project to understand core Java concepts such as:

Object-oriented programming<br>
Event handling<br>
Graphics rendering<br>
Thread management<br>
Game loop implementation<br><br>
The game currently includes a movable character (represented as a white square) that can navigate around a black screen using WASD controls.

Learning Goals<br><br>
This is an exercise to help me learn:

Java programming fundamentals<br>
Game development concepts<br>
Version control with Git and GitHub<br>
Software architecture principles<br>
Development Approach<br><br>
I'm implementing this project using pair programming with AI assistance to:

Add comprehensive code comments<br>
Explain complex Java concepts<br>
Document the codebase for better understanding<br>
Learn best practices for code organization and structure<br><br>
This collaborative approach helps me understand the code more deeply while maintaining clean, well-documented implementations.

Current Features<br><br>
Game window with fixed dimensions<br>
Basic player movement with WASD keys<br>
Consistent frame rate (60 FPS)<br>
Double buffering for smooth rendering<br><br>
Feel free to explore the code as I continue to expand this project with new features while advancing my Java skills!
